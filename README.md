## Stripe Checkout : Rails 6.1

### Overview
[Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) creates a secure, Stripe-hosted payment page that lets you collect payments quickly. It works across all devices and is designed to increase your conversion. Checkout makes it easy to build first-class payments experiences.

This demo consists of a simple integration of the stripe prebuilt checkout with server-side code _(stripe js is no longer a requirement)_. Additionally, stripe webhooks have been incorporated to fetch event data from the stripe server.

[Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) has been integrated to provide email notifications to users, notifications are triggered by stripe webhook events. e.g. users are notified by email when a transaction has been completed.
